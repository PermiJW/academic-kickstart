# About

I am Jiawei Zhao (赵嘉玮), an undergraduate student at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA). During my undergraduate, I studied in computer science; with previous research experiences in Distributed Machine Learning (with [Prof. Animashree Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/) at [California Institute of Technology (Caltech)](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/)) and Active Learning (with [Prof. Sheng-Jun Huang](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/huangsj/) at [NUAA](http://parnec.nuaa.edu.cn/)). I will be a PhD student at Caltech in 2019 Fall.
